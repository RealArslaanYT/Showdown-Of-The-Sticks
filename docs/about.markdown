# Showdown of the Sticks | About

Showdown of the Sticks is a fast-paced, pixel-art fighting game inspired by Smash Bros, Encounters, and Alan Becker’s upcoming game Animation VERSUS. Players pick from four distinct stick figure characters, each with unique themes, weapons, and abilities:

- Crimson Reaper — a red grim-reaper wielding a spectral scythe, specializing in heavy melee strikes and ghostly attacks.
- Cobalt Phantom — a blue ethereal ninja with teleportation and stealth-based moves.
- Emerald Venom — a green snake-themed fighter with poisonous strikes and summoning snake spirits.
- Golden Radiance — a yellow light-powered warrior who uses solar blasts and healing abilities.

The core gameplay revolves around building combos to increase knockback, with strategic use of special abilities to outplay opponents. Players lose lives by falling off the map, and managing knockback counters is key to victory. The game combines nostalgic pixel art with dynamic, skill-based combat for an exciting multiplayer experience.

## Why I Started Making This Game

> I got super excited for Alan Becker's upcoming game **Animation VERSUS** and checked the release estimate on the Kickstarter:  
> **“June 2028.”**  
>  
> So I said, _“What if I just make my own for fun?”_

That moment kicked off the journey behind **Showdown of the Sticks** — a game inspired by fast-paced animation-style combat, pixel art nostalgia, and the sheer chaos of stick figures with superpowers. I’m building this solo (for now), and every step is about making something hype and fun to play.
