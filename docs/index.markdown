## How to Play

### Player 1 controls
- **WASD** to move  
- **F** to attack  
- **Z**, **X**, **C**, and **V** to use abilities
- **E** to use special ability

### Player 2 controls (Local 2P/Local Multiplayer only)
- **Arrow Keys** to move  
- **L** to attack  
- **U**, **I**, **O**, and **P** to use abilities
- **N** to use special ability

Objective: To defeat your opponent by using your abilities to ramp up their knockback counter, then punch them out of the map. 

When a player is hit, their knockback counter on the top of the screen increases.
After 4 consecutive successful hits from the opponent (AKA a combo of 4), the knockback is applied to the player, although the counter does not reset.
If a player dies (falling off the map), the game progresses to the next round, counting the other player as the winner of that round.
A player can use their special ability against their opponent.
Abilities will add to the knockback counter, although they will not apply the knockback until the goal of 4 consecutive successful hits is reached.
Some abilities have the ability to kill the player depending on the knockback counter.
If the knockback counter reaches 1000 or greater without being applied, the player automatically dies.
There are 9 rounds in each match. The player that won the most rounds in that match will win the game.
